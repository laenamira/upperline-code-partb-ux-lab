# Introduction to UX Lab! 
#### The Goal
We're going to build a user journey map! When it's finished, it will look something like this:

Who is the customer? 
What does she need? 
How could the phone carrier have helped Naya better and kept her as a customer?

## An Ideation Game: 1000 Uses
Before we make our journay map, we're going to play a game.
The goal of this game? Thinking outside the box, encouraging wild ideas, and practicing empathy!

First, split off into pairs.
Next, I'm going to give you an object (for example: paperclip, teacup, spoon). 
You and your partner need to come up with 1,000 uses for this object in 2 minutes. 
No repeats! Each of you will take turns in your pairs coming up with new ideas for 2 minutes. 
Let your mind go wild and weird, be funny, and don't stop talking! 
The other partner listens and takes notes, then you switch.
I'll be keeping track of the time! When your time is up, you'll share with us how many ideas you generated. 
The group with the most ideas wins!

## The User Journey Map
Journey maps are a common UX tool. 
They come in all shapes, sizes, and formats. It's equally cool to do it by hand or use a fancy program!
As you've been learning, UX design is a fun and creative job. I encourage you all to brainstorm and play with this map. 

#### Start with a template
There are so many ways to make a journey map. 
Today, we'll use this template.
You can print this one here and complete it by hand or download the PDf and complete it online.

All set with the template? 
We're going to pretend we work in a communications firm, and we've been hired by Universal Fun Kids Camp Inc to design an online camp portal for teens that mimics a classic in-person summer camp experience.
<br>
They've handed our UX team this persona, and they want us to create a user journey map based around this information.

So what is a journey map?
It is a visualization of the process that a person goes through in order to accomplish a goal.
Most journey maps follow a similar format: at the top, you define a specific user, which here would be Frieda, the specific scenario that she is in, and any corresponding expectations she has about this experience; in the middle area, there are 4 phases she will go through when choosing to sign up for camp, and youll need to identify her actions, thoughts, and feelings as shes goes through the process;  at the very bottom, you'll list the takeaways: opportunities, insights, and internal ownership, aka, what the company that is hiring your firm should do to make Frieda signup for camp!

Start by asking: <b>What is Freida's goal?</b> What does she want to accomplish here when signing up for online camp?

Next, for this exercise, the four phases will be defined by the typical emotional up and downs during a teenager's day while on vacation at home. 
Hint: she probably experiences boredom and frustration, and maybe spends a little too much time on social media. 

How will you define the phases of Friedsa's journey? By time of day, or maybe the emotional arc of looking for something fun to do? Be creative.

#### Now, go play! 
Complete your journey map on your own as much as you can, but feel free to huddle up and compare notes after you've worked on it alone for 30 minutes.

And don't forget to fill in the bottom, particularly the Opportunities section:
Where are the biggest opportunities for your client Universal Fun Kids Camp Inc?
How are they going to measure improvements they implement based on Frieda's journey?
