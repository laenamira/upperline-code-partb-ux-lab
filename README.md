# Introduction to UX Lab! 
#### The Goal
We're going to build a user journey map! When it's finished, it will look something like this:

Who is the customer? 
What does she need? 
How could the phone carrier have helped Naya better and kept her as a customer?

## An Ideation Game: 1000 Uses
Before we make our journay map, we're going to play a game.
The goal of this game? Thinking outside the box, encouraging wild ideas, and practicing empathy!

First, split off into pairs.
Next, I'm going to give you an object (for example: paperclip, teacup, spoon). 
You and your partner need to come up with 1,000 uses for this object in 2 minutes. 
No repeats! Each of you will take turns in your pairs coming up with new ideas for 2 minutes. 
Let your mind go wild and weird, be funny, and don't stop talking! 
The other partner listens and takes notes, then you switch.
I'll be keeping track of the time! When your time is up, you'll share with us how many ideas you generated. 
The group with the most ideas wins!

## The User Journey Map
Journey maps are a common UX tool. 
They come in all shapes, sizes, and formats. It's equally cool to do it by hand or use a fancy program!
As you've been learning, UX design is a fun and creative job. I encourage you all to brainstorm and play with this map. 

#### Start with a template
There are so many ways to make a journey map. 
Today, we'll use this template.
You can print this one here and complete it by hand or download the PDf and complete it online.

All set with the template? 
We're going to pretend we work in a communications firm, and our project manager has tasked us with designing an online camp for teens.
They've handed us this persona, and they want us to create a user journey map based around this information.

Note that this is a STRETCH lab, which means that most students will not start it at all, and those who do are only expected to get about halfway through level 1 in the time allotted.

Environment Setup
In order for this game to work, we will need a few things:

A program that will "get" the quiz question. In other words, if we think of the url (the 'link') as an address, we need a way to go get the data waiting for us at that address. We will use a python library called "Requests."
A way to easily read the information that comes back to us from that address.
