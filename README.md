# Introduction to UX Lab! 
#### The Goal
We're going to build a user journey map! When it's finished, it will look something like this:

Who is the customer? 
What does she need? 
What are some changes the phone carrier could make to retain customers like Naya in the future?

## An Ideation Game: 1000 Uses
Before we make our journey map, we're going to play a game.
The goal of this game? Thinking outside the box, encouraging wild ideas, and practicing empathy! All key skills for a UX designer.

First, split off into pairs.
Next, I'm going to give you an object (for example: paperclip, teacup, spoon). 

<b> You and your partner need to come up with 1,000 uses for this object in 2 minutes.</b>

No repeats! Each of you will take turns in your pairs coming up with new ideas for 2 minutes. 

Let your mind go wild and weird, be funny, and don't stop talking! 
The other partner listens and takes notes, then you switch.
I'll be keeping track of the time! When your time is up, you'll share with us how many ideas you generated. 

The group with the most ideas wins!

## The User Journey Map
Journey maps are a common UX tool. 
They come in all shapes, sizes, and formats. It's equally cool to do it by hand or use a fancy program!
As you've been learning, UX design is a fun and creative job. I encourage you all to brainstorm and play with this map. 

#### Start with a template
There are so many ways to make a journey map. 
Today, we'll use this template.
You can print this one here and complete it by hand or download the PDf and complete it online.

All set with the template? 
For this lab today, we're going to pretend we work as freelance designers, and we've been hired by Universal FunKidz Camp Inc to design an online camp portal for teens that mimics a classic in-person summer camp experience.

<br>
They've handed us this persona, and they want us to create a user journey map based around this information.

<b>Meet Frida.</b>

#### What is a journey map?

It is a visualization of the process that a person goes through in order to accomplish a goal.

Most journey maps follow a similar format: at the top, you define a specific user, which here would be Frida, the specific scenario that she is in, and any corresponding expectations she has about this experience; in the middle area, there are 4 phases she will go through when choosing to sign up for camp, and you'll need to identify her actions, thoughts, and feelings as she goes through the process;  at the very bottom, you'll list the takeaways: opportunities, insights, and internal ownership, aka, what the company that is hiring you should do to make Frida signup for camp!

Start by asking: <b>What is Frida's goal?</b> What does she want to accomplish here when signing up for online camp?

Next, for this exercise, the four phases will be defined by the typical emotional up and downs during a teenager's day while on vacation at home. 
Hint: she probably experiences boredom, loneliness, and frustration, and maybe spends a little too much time on social media. 

How will you define the phases of Frida's journey? By time of day, or maybe the emotional arc of looking for something fun to do? Be creative, and use whichever structure will help you learn the most about your client's users, their motivations and needs.

#### Now, go play! 
Complete your journey map on your own as much as you can, but feel free to huddle up and compare notes after you've worked on it alone for 30 minutes.

And don't forget to fill in the bottom, particularly the Opportunities section:
Where are the biggest opportunities for your client Universal FunKidz Camp Inc? What things can they implement based on what you've discovered about Frida and their customers with this journey map?
